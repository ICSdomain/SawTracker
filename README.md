# SawTracker
Saw tracker application intended to keep accurate track of serial numbers, repair history, and location of each assigned saw.
The interface will have grid style boxes or 'tiles' each containing a saw, its serial number, assigned location, and repair history.
The content can be sorted by shift, or searched for directly through use of serial number or assigned location.
